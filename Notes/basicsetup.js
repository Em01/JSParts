/*see index.html script tags can be placed in either the body or head tags or
both.
What this is doing is similar to the link element in css. It applied the JavaScript
to the page so it has an effect on the HTML.

When the HTML is loaded by the browser it is done so it the order that it appears
within the broswer. If the Javascript it placed before the HTML then it may not
work because it would be loaded before the HTML is.

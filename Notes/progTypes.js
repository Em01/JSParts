/*
Dynamic Programming Language:
A language where operations are usually done at runtime
In Js you can change the type of a variable or add new properties or methids to
an object while the prgram is running.
Features 'Dynamic Typing' this gives the programmer more freedom to pass
parameters at runtime without having to define them beforehand.
May also perform some 'self-checking' at runtime which would notmally be done
at the compilation stage.

Static Programming Language:
This is the opposite to a Dynamic langauge and changes 'on the fly' are not
usually possible.

EXAMPLES

Dynamic:
JavaScript, Lisp, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby

Static:
C, C++, Java, COBOL

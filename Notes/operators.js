/* A maths symbol that produces a result based on the values (2 or more)

Addition (also used for concatenation): Adds two numbers or concats two strings
together.
1 + 2;
"Hello " + "world";
n.b when concatenating strings remember to include the whitespace.

Subract: -
1 - 2;

Multiply: 1 * 2;

Divide: 1 / 2;

Assignment: Assigns a value to a variable. Remember when declaring a variable.
var myVariable = 'Bob'
Assignment always goes form right to left, what is on the right of the operator will
always be resolved before the avlue is assigned to the variable on the left
of the operator.

Identity: Tests to see if two values are equal to one another and returns
a true or false value.
2 === 4
var myVariable = 3;
myVariable === 7;
both would return a false value.

Negation: returns the opposite of what it precedes. So, True becomes valse and
vice versa.
!

Not Equal: Tests whether two values are equal to one another
!==
var myVariable = 3;
myVariable !== 7;
This would return true.

Increment:
Alows you to increment (add one to the value)
++

Decrement:
Allows you to decrement (subtract one from the value)

Remainder:
%
Gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.
5 % 2 = 1
(two goes into five twice and leaves one as the remainder)

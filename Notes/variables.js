/*
A variable is a container that stores a value.
Variables are declared with the var keyword.

var myVariable;
myVariable = 'Tim';

this is the same as doing:
var myVariable = 'Tim';

if you call myVariable you will get 'Tim' as the return value

Once you give the variable a value you can change the value later. This is to
do with how JavaScript stores the values.

var myVariable = 'Bob';
console.log(myVariable)
//Bob
myVariable = 'Steve'
console.log(myVariable)
//Steve

Naming Rules:
Cannot start with a number-the variable can have numbers in it.
No maths or logical operator can be included in the variable name.
No punctuation marks of any kind except for an underscore. e.g h:i
No keywords on their own.
Case Sensitive.

DataTypes:
String:
var myVariable = 'Bob';

Number:
var myVariable = 2;

Boolean:
var myVariable = true;

Array:
var myVariable = [1, 2, 3]

Object:
var myVariable = {}

Changing values enables dynamic. Without variables we really wouldn't be able to
do anything.

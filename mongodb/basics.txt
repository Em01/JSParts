Document or no sql database.
There is no such thing as schema or design. You simply store the json object in mongodb.

To create a Schema:

const course = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String
})

To Create a model which is essentially a class:

const Course = mongoose.model('Course', courseSchema) //class
const course = new Course({
  name: 'Node.js Course'
})

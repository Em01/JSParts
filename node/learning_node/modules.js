/*
MODULES:
* http
* filesystem
* os
* events



* Using a module and defining variables within the scope of these
modules means that you won't override other functions due to encapsulation.
Each program has one file that you would consider to be the main module (e.g app.js)
A module is not a global object, The variables defined within the module are scoped
to that module.

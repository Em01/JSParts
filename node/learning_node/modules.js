/*
MODULES:
* http
* filesystem
* os
* events



* Using a module and defining variables within the scope of these
modules means that you won't override other functions due to encapsulation.
Each program has one file that you would consider to be the main module (e.g app.js)
A module is not a global object, The variables defined within the module are scoped
to that module.

Path: Gives you access to utilities for accessubg and working with file and directory paths.

OS: For working with the operating system.

Filesystem: For working with Files and directories. Almost every operation here is wither synchronous and blocking
or asynchronous and non-blocking.

* One of JavaScripts most popular technologies

* Allows you to write Server Side code with JS

* Uses JavaScripts V8 engine which is at the core of node js 

*V8 Engine:
Opensource
*The microprocessor is a tiny machine which gets given instructions. The set of instructions are called machine code. Microprocessors have specific languages that they are designed to speak:
IA-32
x86-64
ARM
MIPS
Node is written in C++
You write node in JavaScript
V8 is written in C++
V8 converts javascript into machine code
Node adds on to V8 and is also written in C++
V8 can run standalone or it can be embedded into any C++ application. You can put V8 inside your C++ program and use i. V8 has hooks that can be used inside C++ program.
js - v8 - machine code
or
js - my c++ program - machine code
With the latter javascript still gets run through v8 but because you are running through c++ which is the same language as v8 there are hooks which can be used to add features to JS. Therefore the program will be able to understand more than what the ECMAScript specifies that JS should understand. This is very powerful because C++ has more features than JS as a programming language. JS was designed to be in the browser, it was not designed to deal with lower level operations
such as filees on hard drive. 

* Machine code: Code that will run on the processor. It is a programming langauge whih is spoken by the computer processor
Every program run on a computer has been compiled into machine code.
All code eventually becoes machine code
Machine code is very low level so instead of directly writing it(some people do) we write in languages which are compiled into machine code. 
As time passes we have gone further away from writing low level languages into writing higher level ones (such as js).
Machine language speaks directly to the microprocessor and is not abstracted from what is happening.
With high level languages such as JS you are v far removed and do not directly deal with memory directly. You have an engine between you and the microprocessor that is taking care of this for you - this is the v8 engine.

ECMAScript: The standard that JavaScript was based on. It is needed because there are many javascript engines.

Node JS is a C++ program with v8 embedded and it has added a wealth of great features that make it suitable to be a server technology.

run node in terminal: node
quit node in the terminal: ctrl c twice

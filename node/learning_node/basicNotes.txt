* One of JavaScripts most popular technologies

* Allows you to write Server Side code with JS

* Uses JavaScripts V8 engine which is at the core of node js 

*V8 Engine:
*The microprocessor is a tiny machine which gets given instructions. The set of instructions are called machine code. Microprocessors have specific languages that they are designed to speak:
IA-32
x86-64
ARM
MIPS
Node is written in C++
You write node in JavaScript
V8 is written in C++
V8 converts javascript into machine code
Node adds on to V8 and is also written in C++

* Machine code is a programming langauge whih is spoken by the computer processor
Every program run on a computer has been compiled into machine code.
All code eventually becoes machine code
Machine code is very low level so instead of directly writing it(some people do) we write in languages which are compiled into machine code. 
As time passes we have gone further away from writing low level languages into writing higher level ones (such as js).
Machine language speaks directly to the microprocessor and is not abstracted from what is happening.
With high level languages such as JS you are v far removed and do not directly deal with memory directly. You have an engine between you and the microprocessor that is taking care of this for you - this is the v8 engine.
